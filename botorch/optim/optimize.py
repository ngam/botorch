            function optimization.

            if `batch_initial_conditions` is not specified.
        options: Options for candidate generation.
        inequality constraints: A list of tuples (indices, coefficients, rhs),
            with each tuple encoding an inequality constraint of the form
            `\sum_i (X[indices[i]] * coefficients[i]) >= rhs`

            with each tuple encoding an inequality constraint of the form
            `\sum_i (X[indices[i]] * coefficients[i]) = rhs`
        fixed_features: A map `{feature_index: value}` for features that
            should be fixed to a particular value during generation.
        post_processing_func: A function that post-processes an optimization
            result appropriately (i.e., according to `round-trip`

            random restart initializations of the optimization.
        sequential: If False, uses joint optimization, otherwise uses sequential

    For `q > 1` this function generates candidates by means of sequential

    evaluate quickly explodes.
